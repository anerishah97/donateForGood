# donateForGood

This mini project was made as a part of the course requirements for Semester 5, Web Technology as prescribed by Mumbai University.

Donate for Good is a donation portal, where you can donate old things at one click, sitting at home and an NGO agency will come to pick up the items and donate it to an orphanage/old age house.
